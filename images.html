<p> <h3> I hope you have a wonderful day today and I just wanted to let you know I'm so proud of you and everything that you have accomplished ever since I first met you. I hope you have lots of fun and make sure you drink. You have friends that are worth keeping, parents who care a lot about you and want you to succeed, and a boyfriend who loves you so so much that he would do anything for you. We always have your back baby!! You’re the most hardworking person I know, you’re always helping out and on top of your shit! I want to thank you for everything you have done for me and show me the love and care I never received before! To my best friend, my partner, my lover, I LOVE YOU! HAPPY BIRTHDAY!! I can’t wait to see what Oregon has for us and what life has for us in the future.

<h2>Hope you Liked It!</h2>



I hope you liked what I made you :)! I wanted to make you something that you couldn't buy from the store or from online. I wanted to give you something original, something from me, and something you wouldn't most likely see elsewhere. It sucks that I can't be with you right now but I'm still trying my best to give you something special, so I hope you like this. I wanted to make something for you that you can always look back on. This is made just for you, and it's made to where you can access it and see it wherever you are if you have WIFI or a browser. I wanted you to have something unique and different but also something that it's easy to look at. But the biggest reason I made this is because I know you're really stressed, and I wanted you to have something that you can look at and be reminded that no matter what happens I will love and care about you and have your back always. I really hope you like it!! I hope I get to do more things like this for you. I love you and I always will <3!
